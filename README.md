# Copy Issue ID

A WebExtension for quickly converting issue IDs into clickable links.

NOTE: This is my experimental tool and tested only on Firefox. I might register
it on Firefox Addons or Chrome Web Store if it proves to be useful.

Please install it from "about:debugging" in Firefox if you are willing to try.

## Features

* Adds a shortcut to the context menu.
* Extracts issue IDs (such as AAA-123) from selected text and converts to URLs.
* Supports converting them into a clickable links as well.
* Customizable conversion rules.
